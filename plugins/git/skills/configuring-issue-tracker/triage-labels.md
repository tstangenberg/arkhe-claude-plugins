# Triage Labels

The `triaging-issues` skill speaks in terms of five canonical triage roles, plus two category roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker.

| Role             | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`   | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`     | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`| `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`| `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`        | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |
| `bug` (category) | `bug`                | Something is broken                      |
| `enhancement` (category) | `enhancement` | New feature or improvement              |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the ready-for-agent triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the "Label in our tracker" column to match the vocabulary you actually use.
